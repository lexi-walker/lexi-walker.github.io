		Hi! I am a current sophomore at the Tufts University School of Engineering in pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I'm interested in exploring a variety of areas within computer science including UI/UX, software engineering and security, as well as the intersection between computer science and the medical field.
